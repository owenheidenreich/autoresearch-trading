# v2 Lab Notebook — Exact-Chain Reset Era

Pre-exact-chain history lives in `archive/v2_historical/logs/lab_notebook_pre_exact_chain.md`.
The full mixed-state notebook before this reset lives in `archive/v2_historical/logs/lab_notebook_pre_reset_mixed_state_2026-04-10.md`.

## Reset Reconciliation (2026-04-10)

- Restored `v2/train.py` to the `exp_080`-style baseline: gate BCE plus soft KL selection only
- Archived non-official `results.tsv` rows so live `v2/results.tsv` now holds official exact-chain scored runs only
- Moved stale live helpers and plan docs out of `v2/`
- `exp_088` and `exp_089` remain preserved in git and archive notes, but they have no authoritative scored result and are not part of the live evidence base
- Next experiment ID: `exp_092`

## Established Facts

### Diagnostic 1: Oracle Replay

| Window | Score | WR | DD | C/P | Trades |
|--------|-------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Test (60d) | **6.000** | 100% | 0% | 267/268 | 535 |
| Train (846d) | **6.000** | 100% | 0% | 3746/3718 | 7464 |

Verdict: the evaluation harness is achievable.

### Diagnostic 2: Direction Signal

| Features | Train acc | Test acc | Baseline |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Current bar (47 features) | 61.1% | **60.9%** | 52.6% |
| Window mean/std (lb=30, 141 features) | 62.6% | 60.2% | 52.6% |
| Window mean/std (lb=60, 141 features) | 62.4% | 60.5% | 52.6% |
| Window mean/std (lb=90, 141 features) | 62.4% | 60.9% | 52.6% |

Verdict: the signal exists in the current bar, and longer lookback has not helped in the diagnostic.

Top predictive features:

1. `put_call_txn_ratio`
2. `trend_5min`
3. `gamma`
4. `rsi_7`

## Official Exact-Chain Runs

| Exp | Score | Folds | Status | Hypothesis |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| 074 | 0.000 | [0,0,0,0,0] | revert | exact-chain baseline attempt — zero trades all folds |
| 075 | 0.000 | [0,0,0,0,0] | revert | decouple gate from selection — still zero trades |
| 076 | -0.040 | [0,0,0,-0.2,0] | revert | gate threshold disabled — one fold fired |
| 077 | -0.300 | [-0.3,-0.3,-0.3,-0.3,-0.3] | revert | selection-only variant still negative |
| 078 | -0.740 | [-1,-0.5,-1,-1,-0.2] | revert | stronger direct PnL regression worsened edge |

## Screening History (2026-04-10)

| Exp | Change | Direction Balance | WR | Trades | DD | Key Finding |
|-----|--------|-------------------|----|--------|----|-------------|
| 079 | soft KL selection (`temp=0.05`) | 16C/54P | 27.1% | — | 102.9% | first exact-chain screen to beat 2/4 baselines |
| 080 | `PNL_W=0`, `SOFT_TEMP=0.20` | 179C/244P | 36.2% | 423 | 104% | best screening baseline; removing direct PnL regression fixed direction collapse |
| 081 | `NO_TRADE_W=3.0` | 62C/143P | 32.2% | 205 | 103% | gate reweighting was unstable |
| 082 | `PNL_W=0.1` | 25C/197P | 28.8% | 222 | 102% | even weak direct PnL regression reimposed direction collapse |
| 083 | auxiliary `side_head` | 568C/7P | 31.3% | 575 | 101% | side head corrupted the shared context encoder |
| 084 | `GATE_W=3.0` | 86C/277P | 33.9% | 363 | 101% | stronger gate weight did not solve overtrading |
| 085 | `gate_threshold=0.0` | 228C/132P | 32.2% | 360 | 102% | threshold tuning filtered randomly rather than by quality |
| 086 | side-masked KL targets | 316C/84P | 30.5% | 400 | 103% | masking to one side lost the useful signal |
| 087 | `SOFT_TEMP=1.0` | 250C/106P | 31.7% | 356 | 100% | overly soft KL worsened direction |
| 090 | no-change reset baseline re-screen | 179C/244P | 36.2% | 423 | 104% | post-reset baseline reproduced the old failure mode; hard gate failed on excessive drawdown with score `-0.2` |
| 091 | focal gate BCE (`alpha=0.25`, `gamma=2.0`) | 405C/6P | 32.1% | 411 | 100% | focal gate worsened behavior into severe call-side collapse; hard gate failed on direction balance with score `-0.3` |
| 092 | `tanh` on contract score head output | 549C/1P | 28.4% | 550 | 101% | tanh saturation killed selection gradients; total direction collapse into all-calls; score `-0.3` |
| 093 | `LOOKBACK=1` current-bar-only | 357C/1P | 33.0% | 358 | 102% | removing temporal context caused call collapse; lookback provides useful direction signal despite diagnostic; score `-0.3` |

## Current Live Baseline

- Gate BCE plus soft KL selection only
- `SOFT_TEMP=0.20`
- No direct PnL regression
- No auxiliary side head
- No gate reweighting
- No score regularization

## Abandoned Or Parked Approaches

- direct PnL regression in the live loss stack
- shared auxiliary side heads
- gate BCE reweighting
- treating `exp_088` or `exp_089` as scored evidence
- tanh-bounded score head (gradient saturation kills selection)
- LOOKBACK=1 current-bar-only (temporal context needed for direction balance)

## Hypothesis Queue

1. `exp_094`: `SOFT_TEMP=0.10` — tighter selection targets to strengthen gate gradients
2. `exp_095`: reduced model capacity (`D_MODEL=48`, `DEPTH=2`) to prevent overfitting majority class
3. Defer detached two-stage side models until simpler replay-compatible changes are exhausted

## Active Experiment Kickoff

### `exp_090` — Baseline Re-Screen (2026-04-10)

- Type: screening run
- Code change: none
- Purpose: confirm that the reset baseline, live docs, gate, and remote runner still form one trustworthy starting point
- Expected outcome: a clean 1-fold reference result for the restored `exp_080`-style baseline
- Result:
  - score: `-0.200`
  - gate failure: `excessive_drawdown (104.4% > 20%)`
  - trades: `423`
  - direction balance: `179C / 244P`
  - win rate: `36.2%`
  - baseline comparison: beat `ATM` and `ATM-trailing`, failed to beat `random` and `simple-rules`
- Decision: do not run the official `exp_090`
- Takeaway: the reset baseline is now re-established as a trustworthy post-reset reference, and it still fails for the same reason as the earlier `exp_080` screening regime: overtrading with unacceptable drawdown
- Next step: move to `exp_091` with one targeted change to the gate objective

### `exp_091` — Focal-Style Gate Loss (2026-04-10)

- Type: screening run
- Code change: replace plain mean gate BCE with focal-weighted BCE using `GATE_FOCAL_ALPHA=0.25` and `GATE_FOCAL_GAMMA=2.0`
- Purpose: penalize easy majority trade examples less and emphasize the minority no-trade mistakes that appear to drive overtrading
- Constant parts:
  - same model architecture
  - same selection KL target
  - same replay policy
  - same `SOFT_TEMP=0.20`
- Result:
  - score: `-0.300`
  - gate failure: `direction_collapse (balance=0.01 < 0.15)`
  - trades: `411`
  - direction balance: `405C / 6P`
  - win rate: `32.1%`
  - baseline comparison: failed all four baselines
- Decision: revert the `exp_091` code change and do not run the official `exp_091`
- Takeaway: focal weighting destabilized the gate and collapsed the model into an almost all-call regime instead of reducing overtrading safely
- Next step: move to `exp_092` with a bounded score-head change rather than more gate-loss weighting

### `exp_092` — Tanh-Bounded Score Head (2026-04-10)

- Type: screening run
- Code change: `torch.tanh()` applied to `score_head` output, bounding contract scores to [-1, 1]
- Purpose: prevent unbounded score magnitudes from destabilizing the gate decision
- Constant parts:
  - same model architecture
  - same selection KL target
  - same replay policy
  - same `SOFT_TEMP=0.20`
- Result:
  - score: `-0.300`
  - gate failure: `direction_collapse (balance=0.00 < 0.15)`
  - trades: `550`
  - direction balance: `549C / 1P`
  - win rate: `28.4%`
  - baseline comparison: failed all four baselines
- Decision: revert
- Takeaway: tanh saturation killed selection gradients — the model couldn't differentiate contracts within the [-1, 1] range and collapsed into all-calls. Training metrics showed gate_acc and trade_rate completely flat across all 14 epochs (0.757, 0.937), confirming the gate never learned. Bounded score approaches that saturate are not viable.
- Next step: move to `exp_093` with `LOOKBACK=1` architecture test

### `exp_093` — LOOKBACK=1 Current-Bar-Only (2026-04-10)

- Type: screening run
- Code change: `LOOKBACK` default changed from 30 to 1
- Purpose: test whether the 30-bar transformer window adds noise, since diagnostic showed current-bar features alone achieve 60.9% test direction accuracy
- Constant parts:
  - same loss function
  - same selection KL target
  - same replay policy
  - same `SOFT_TEMP=0.20`
- Result:
  - score: `-0.300`
  - gate failure: `direction_collapse (balance=0.00 < 0.15)`
  - trades: `358`
  - direction balance: `357C / 1P`
  - win rate: `33.0%`
  - profit factor: `0.625` (better than baseline's ~0.40 range)
  - baseline comparison: failed all four baselines
- Decision: revert
- Takeaway: removing temporal context caused call-side collapse despite the diagnostic showing current-bar features alone have 60.9% direction accuracy. The transformer's temporal attention provides something the logistic regression diagnostic doesn't capture — likely ordering/momentum cues needed for balanced call/put selection. The LOOKBACK=30 window is load-bearing for direction balance.
- Next step: move to `exp_094` with `SOFT_TEMP=0.10` to tighten selection targets
